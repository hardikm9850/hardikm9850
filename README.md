**Talking about Professional journey:**

Since 2014, I have embarked on a software engineering journey, immersing myself in various domains such as B2B, B2C, Gaming, Banking, and Ed-Tech, primarily focusing on native Android app development. Throughout this time, I have gained experience in developing robust applications for different industries. Additionally, I have also dabbled in Python backend projects.

Passionate about learning and innovating in the Android ecosystem, I actively contribute to Open Source projects, aiming to collaborate with fellow developers and give back to the community.

I am exploring Go Language with mentorship from [Ishan Khare](https://github.com/ishankhare07), aiming to enhance my backend development skills and become a full-stack mobile developer and eventually evolve into a proficient technical architect. 

**Gratitude[કૃતજ્ઞતા]**

I've been deeply inspired by the engineering managers I had the opportunity to collaborate with, even if only briefly.🙏🏼
