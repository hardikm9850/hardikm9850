**Talking about Professional journey:**

Since 2014, I have embarked on a software engineering journey, immersing myself in various domains such as B2B, B2C, Gaming, Banking, and Ed-Tech, primarily focusing on native Android app development. Throughout this time, I have gained experience in developing robust applications for different industries. Additionally, I have also dabbled in Python backend projects.

Driven by my passion for continuous growth and innovation, I enjoy exploring new technologies in the Android ecosystem. I actively contribute to the Open Source community, striving to give back and collaborate with fellow developers. 

Currently, I am delving into the world of Flutter, broadening my skill set and expanding my horizons in mobile app development.
